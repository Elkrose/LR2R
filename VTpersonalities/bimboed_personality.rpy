### PERSONALITY CHARACTERISTICS ###
# Bimbo is slang for a conventionally attractive, sexualized na√Øve woman. The term was originally used in the United States as early as 1919 for an unintelligent or brutish man. As of the early 21st century, the "stereotypical bimbo" appearance became akin to that of a physically attractive woman.
#However, as with most identities, the idea of the 'bimbo' has evolved and here is what it means today. The term 'bimbofication' is a colloquial term derived from the term 'bimbo' which is understood to mean, 'an attractive woman who is pretty, sexualised, naive and uneducated'.
